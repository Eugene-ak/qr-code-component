## My process

### Built with

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styling
- [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project introduced me to styling with `Sass`. I learnt how to integrate sass into react applications, write clean sass syntax and partition sass code into different files. I also learnt sass concepts such as nesting and declaring variables and mixins (css functions) which can be used to reduce redundancy.

### Continued development

Although I am conversant with the basics of sass, I will like to learn more about it as it makes css more lightweight. I will use it in my next projects in order to understand how it works and why I should prefer sass to other styling approaches.
